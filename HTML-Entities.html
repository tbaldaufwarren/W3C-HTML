    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.</p>
    <p>If you use the less than (&lt;) or greater than (&gt;) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.</p>
    <p>Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.</p>
    <p>A character entitiy looks like this:</p>
    
    <p>&entity_name; <br> OR <br>&#entity_number;</p>
    
    <h2>Non-breaking Space</h2>
    <p>A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: & nbsp;</p>
    <p>A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.</p>
    <p>Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ยง 10</li>
        <li>10 km/h</li>
        <li>10 PM</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.</p>
    <p>If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. to add real spaces to your text, you can use the & nbsp; character entity. </p>
    <p style="background-color:wheat;"><b>Tip:</b> The non-breaking hyphen (& #8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (-) that does not break into a new line.</p>

    <h2>Combining Diacritical Marks</h2>
    <p>A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter</p>
    <p>Some diacritical marks, like grave ( &#768;) and acute ( &#769;) are called accents.</p>
    <p>Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.</p>
    <p>Diacritical marks can be sued in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page</p>
