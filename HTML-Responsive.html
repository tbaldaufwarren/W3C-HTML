    <h1>HTML Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <p>Responsive web design is about creating web pages that look good on all devices!</p>
    <p>A responsive web design will automatically adjust for different screen sizes and viewports.</p>

    <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
    <p>Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):</p>

    <h2>Setting The Viewport</h2>
    <p>To create a responsive website, add the following <mark>&lt;meta&gt;</mark> tag to all your web pages:</p>
    <p>&lt;meta name="viewport" content=caling.</p>
    
    <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
    <p>Responsive images are images th"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"</p>

    <p>This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and sat scale nicely to fit any browser size</p>
    <h3>Using the width property</h3>
    <p>If the CSS <mark>width</mark> property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:</p>
    <img src="images/img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">
    <p>Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the <mark>max-width</mark> property instea.</p>

    <h3>Using the max-width Property</h3>
    <p>If the <mark>max-width</mark> property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be alrger than its original size:</p>
    <img src="images/img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

    <h3>Show Different Images Depending on Browser Width</h3>
    <p>The HTML <mark>&lt;picture&gt;</mark> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes.</p>
    <p>Resize the browser window to see how the image below change depending on the width:</p>
    <picture>
        <source srcset="images/img_smallflower.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)">
        <source srcset="images/img_flowers.jpg" media="(max-width: 1500px)">
        <source srcset="images/flowers.jpg">
        <img src="img_flowers.jpg" alt="Flowers" style="width:auto;">
      </picture>

      <h2>Responsive Text Size</h2>
      <p>The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".</p>
      <p>That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:</p>

      <h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>

      <h2>Media Queries</h2>
      <p>In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.</p>
      <p>With media queries you can define completely different styles for different browser sizes.</p>
      
      <h2>Responsive Web Design - Framework</h2>
      <p>All popular CSS Frameworks offer responsive design.</p>
      <p>They are free, and easy to use.</p>
