    <h1>HTML Symbols</h1>
    <p>Symbols that are not present on your keyboard can also be added by using entities.</p>

    <h2>HTML Symbol Entities</h2>
    <p>HTML entities were described in the previous chapter</p>
    <p>Many mathematical, technical, and currency symbols, are not present on a normal keyboard.</p>
    <p>To add such symbols to an HTML page, you can use the entity name or the entity number (a decimal or a hexadecimal reference) for the symbol.</p>
